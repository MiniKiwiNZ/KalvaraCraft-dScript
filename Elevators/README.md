# dElevators: *Simple Elevators Powered by Denizen*

## Configuration
Inside the `Elevators.dsc` file, you will find two settings that can be changed:
- **MaxDistance**: The maximum distance allowed between two elevator blocks for them to work (*set to -1 to disable*)
- **MaxPerChunk**: The maximum number of elevators that can be contained within a single chunk (*set to -1 to disable*)

## Usage
You can create an elevator by crafting together four iron blocks and an ender pearl like so:

Elevator blocks placed vertically above each other will form a chain of elevators that can be moved between by jumping and sneaking.
Elevator blocks are able to be decorated with carpets or snow and will still function.
Elevators cannot be pushed by pistons or blown up.

## Installation
Simply install the `Elevators.dsc` file into your Denizen scripts directory and reload your active scripts using `/ex reload`
